# Task 1:You have been given a piece of code with several variable and constant names that don't follow the Python 
# naming convention. Your task is to correct them:

pi_value = 3.14
user_Age = 25
user_location = ("New York")
MAX_LIMIT = 1000

# MAXLIMIT was tricky for me, considering the variable represents a 
# constant, the only thing I could think to do was add an underscore,
# and even that, may not have been necessary.
